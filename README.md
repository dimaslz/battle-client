Project url: [https://battle-board.dimaslz.dev/](https://battle-board.dimaslz.dev/)

## Motivation

This simple game it's just for fun!. One of my restlessness was to use SocketIO and NestJS framework to make a simple API. In while, I was thinking some good ideas to implement and increase the playability and more.

## TODO

- [ ] Add unit tests (I start it just prototyping, now I think is something that could be good to keep safe)
- [ ] Improve board UI
- [ ] Improve count down synchronization
- [ ] Cached your data, playerID and always have the same
- [ ] Maybe can create an account? (send me a issue if you like the idea)
- [ ] Improve feedback with the user
- [ ] Port to mobile app
- [ ] ...
